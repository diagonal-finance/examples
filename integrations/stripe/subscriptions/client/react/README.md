## Diagonal with Stripe integration client example

This example shows how you can build a subscription integration handlig fiat and crypto payments using [Diagonal](https://docs.diagonal.finance) with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The client is dependent on the server, which is a Node.js app. Follow the guide at [integrations/stripes/subscriptions](./../../README.md#how-to-run-locally) to be able to run the entire demo.

## How to run locally

### Requirements

- NPM v8+

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start

```bash
npm start
```

Your default browser should now open with the client being served from `http://localhost:3000/`.
