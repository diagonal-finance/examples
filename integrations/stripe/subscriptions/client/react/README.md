## Diagonal with Stripe integration client example

This example shows how you can build a subscription integration with Stripe using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## How to run locally

In order to start the client, you'll need to: 

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix client/react
```

### Run

```bash
npm start --prefix client/react
```

Your default browser should now open with the client being served from `http://localhost:3000/`.

Note that you should also run the server in order to have the complete sample integration. Follow the guide at [integrations/stripes/subscriptions](./../../README.md#how-to-run-locally)
