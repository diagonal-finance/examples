## Diagonal with Stripe integration client example

This example shows how you can build a subscription integration with Stripe using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## How to run locally

In order to start only the client, you'll need to: 

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix client/react
```

### Start

```bash
npm start --prefix client/react
```

Your default browser should now open with the client being served from `http://localhost:3000/`.
